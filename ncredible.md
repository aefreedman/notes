#NYU Game Center + NYC Media Lab + NBC Client Consulting Workshop Takeaways and Notes

This past Saturday I participated in a workshop at the NYU Game Center in partnership with the NYC Media Lab and NBC. A small team inside NBC was seeking feedback and game design thinking on a news quiz game they are developing. About a dozen Game Center students and alumni joined, and we worked with Wade Tinney as he guided us through the process. These are a few of the takeaways from the workshop.

1. Client consultation bootcamp with Wade Tinney
2. Project pitch and summary from NBC

6. Live pitches to client with feedback
   
## Notes from the consultation bootcamp
### Meeting the Client
* Pay attention to body language
    - Posture, esp. seating and arms
* Listen actively
    - Take notes (it signals that you are paying attention)
* Imagine that you are already part of the team
    - Making suggestions as "we" instead of "you" or "I" helps you and the client imagine your collaboration
* Communicate your enthusiasm
* Have questions
* Treat calls (remote meetings) the same way you would treat in-person meetings
* Ask to meet the client in-person if possible

### Questions you should ask the client
Note: Use your judgement on how and when to ask these questions.
* What development resources are available? (Team size, experience, other partnerships, etc.)
* What is the budget? Audience? Platform?
* Scope? Timeline?
* Monetization strategy? (Business model)
* What does the client already know about the game?
* What data do we have from playtesting?
* What is success for this project?
* What heuristics are we using to measure success?
* What is the marketing strategy?
* Who else is competing for the contract? (If you're pitching something)
* Who is making decisions about the contract award?
* How real is the project and where is the RFP coming from?
* Has the client worked on games before?
* Who else has the client worked with?
* Who is the competition (for the product)? (Market analysis)

## Takeaways
* Data driven game design or game design as a formula
* Bring back the fun
* Too many cooks in the kitchen
* Lean startup via megacorp
* Think about the designers
* Content creation for a news game is a design problem
* Valuable playtesting practices are not obvious
* Thinking through designs that are not yours is refreshing

## Notes
* Was interesting to see how game ideas come out of large companies
    - someone at the company as an idea that involves a game and they think it would be a good thing to make, they get a budget to work on a prototype.
* Surprised a the budget provided to the team to make the prototype
* The influence of data driven design on the production of the prototype is disheartening. There's a lot of time spent on developing features in pursuit of viral capabilities before there is any means to test whether they are effective of if the core game design is compelling enough to warrant sharing in the first place
* Making an app and then trying to make it fun after the fact is difficult. At the same time it brings up the question of whether the users of an app like this actually care to play a "fun game"
* One of the great thing about indie game developers is that they can have a clear game design vision that allows for unique experiences. NCredible feels diluted by too many stakeholders with purely monetary concerns that starve the game of an ability to explore exciting design spaces before business concerns.
* I'm sympathetic to the developers behind the game. They're still passionate about the project and it's easy to see myself in their shoes when they are talking about the project.
* There's a fine line between running a workshop for stdents via a real company and getting free labor out of students. At the same time there's a certain freedom afforded when you know that you have nothing to lose by coming up with some hairbrained idea. 
* Its much like waht making games in sie a game design program is like.
* thinking about the problem of content creation for Ncredible was one of the most interesting parts of the game.
    - News items are ephemeral
    - Interesting questions are hard to write
    - Someone has to be informed about the topic in order to create interesting questions
    - Do you limit the users' velocity through your content bases on how quickly you can make the content, or do you try to come up with a method of creating content more quickly to adapt to how your users consume the content you create?
* Talking to developers of a game that are outside of the "game design community" is interesting.
* It's hard not to fall into a teacher/student mindset while at a workshop at a university alongside students
* I'm surprised y how little substantive playtesting happens for the game outside of family and friends
* Consulting is fun and refreshing. It's nice to think about a design problem for a project that you do not need to then develop yourself. It provides you with freedom to think of ideas and solutions without ultimate responsibility.
