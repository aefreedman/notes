#Game Design Consulting Workshop Takeaways
### NYU Game Center + NYC Media Lab + NBC 

This past Saturday I participated in a workshop at the NYU Game Center in partnership with the NYC Media Lab and NBC. A small development team inside NBC sought feedback and game design thinking on their news quiz game. About a dozen Game Center students and alumni joined and we worked with Wade Tinney as he guided us through the process. These are a few of the takeaways from the workshop.

## Workshop Format

The workshop ran from 10AM to 5PM (we ran a bit over time)

1. Client consultation bootcamp with Wade Tinney
2. Project pitch and summary from NBC
3. Breakout session in small teams to create response pitches
4. Short question and answer session with the client (NBC)
5. Final touches to presentation & dry run feedback from Wade
6. Live pitches to client with feedback
   
## Consultation bootcamp

### Meeting the Client

* Pay attention to body language
    - Posture, esp. seating and arms<br><br>
* Listen actively
    - Take notes (it signals that you are paying attention)<br><br>
* Imagine that you are already part of the team
    - Making suggestions as "we" instead of "you" or "I" helps you and the client imagine your collaboration<br><br>
* Communicate your enthusiasm
* Have questions
* Treat calls (remote meetings) the same way you would treat in-person meetings
* Ask to meet the client in-person if possible
<br><br>

### Questions you should ask the client

Note: Use your judgement on how and when to ask these questions.

* What development resources are available? (Team size, experience, other partnerships, etc.)
* What is the budget? Audience? Platform?
* Scope? Timeline?
* Monetization strategy? (Business model)
* What does the client already know about the game?
* What data do we have from playtesting?
* What is success for this project?
* What heuristics are we using to measure success?
* What is the marketing strategy?
* Who else is competing for the contract? (If you're pitching something)
* Who is making decisions about the contract award?
* How real is the project and where is the RFP coming from?
* Has the client worked on games before?
* Who else has the client worked with?
* Who is the competition (for the product)? (Market analysis)

## Takeaways
* __Game design as a formula__
    - I was surprised by the emphasis on player rentention and virality from the _inception_ of the development process. I sympathize with the necessity for games like this to self-sustain when run as a service, but I also believe that thinking about MAU and MARPU _from the start of the design process_ is detrimental.<br><br>
* __Bring back the fun__
    - I was taken aback that user enjoyment (*fun*) wasn't a key performance indicator (KPI). I was yelling "Games are supposed to be fun!" at one point during the breakout session.<br><br>
* __Too many cooks in the kitchen__
    - I could see how the development team was struggling to satisfy the requirements of multiple stakeholders inside NBC. This showed in the way that the development team presented the game to us.<br><br>
* __Lean startup via megacorp__
    - With the previous point in mind, it was also curious to see the parallels between a small startup (like my own) and the development team inside NBC. The most significant difference, business-wise, was that they have an established investor with clear requirements.<br><br>
* __Think about the designers__
    - As a designer, I sometimes get caught up thinking about game designs as systems or otherwise abstract constructs that exist on their own. Consulting is different in that you also need to mind the needs and desires of the client, of course with respect to the project, but more importantly with respect to the client as other humans whom you're collaborating with.<br><br>
* __Thinking through designs that are not yours is refreshing__
    - It's fun to think through a design problem that you don't need to see through to completion. It's also fun to insert yourself into a project that is already in production. It's much more like being a tinker or a hacker, or maybe even a bit like being a doctor.<br><br>
* __Don't get sucked into the black hole__
    - This is a counterpoint to the previous point about seeing the project through the eyes of the client. In retrospect I wish we had taken a riskier approach in the ideas we pitched to the client. <br><br>
* __Content creation for a news game is a design problem__
    - I kept returning to content when I was thinking through the design. The essential question was how do you efficiently and effectively create daily questions from news (when you have four people on the development team). There's no obvious solution. I could go into much greater detail on this but I'll save it for another time.<br><br>
* __Valuable playtesting practices are not obvious__
    - Given that MAU and retention were critical to the KPI formula the team was using, I was shocked that there wasn't a heuristic for determining whether they were accomplishing this with their current iteration. Retention is difficult to track until it's live, but I think you can also get a good sense of how compelling an experience you're creating by playtesting with users that aren't friends and family. This relates back to including "fun" as a KPI and having _some_ kind of methodology for interpreting playtesting results (simply collecting data doesn't count!). Valuable information comes from qualitiative methods and part of the art of game design is interpreting qualitative feedback.

 Notes
* Was interesting to see how game ideas come out of large companies
    - someone at the company as an idea that involves a game and they think it would be a good thing to make, they get a budget to work on a prototype.
* Surprised a the budget provided to the team to make the prototype
* The influence of data driven design on the production of the prototype is disheartening. There's a lot of time spent on developing features in pursuit of viral capabilities before there is any means to test whether they are effective of if the core game design is compelling enough to warrant sharing in the first place
* Making an app and then trying to make it fun after the fact is difficult. At the same time it brings up the question of whether the users of an app like this actually care to play a "fun game"
* One of the great thing about indie game developers is that they can have a clear game design vision that allows for unique experiences. NCredible feels diluted by too many stakeholders with purely monetary concerns that starve the game of an ability to explore exciting design spaces before business concerns.
* I'm sympathetic to the developers behind the game. They're still passionate about the project and it's easy to see myself in their shoes when they are talking about the project.
* There's a fine line between running a workshop for stdents via a real company and getting free labor out of students. At the same time there's a certain freedom afforded when you know that you have nothing to lose by coming up with some hairbrained idea. 
* Its much like waht making games in sie a game design program is like.
* thinking about the problem of content creation for Ncredible was one of the most interesting parts of the game.
    - News items are ephemeral
    - Interesting questions are hard to write
    - Someone has to be informed about the topic in order to create interesting questions
    - Do you limit the users' velocity through your content bases on how quickly you can make the content, or do you try to come up with a method of creating content more quickly to adapt to how your users consume the content you create?
* Talking to developers of a game that are outside of the "game design community" is interesting.
* It's hard not to fall into a teacher/student mindset while at a workshop at a university alongside students
* I'm surprised y how little substantive playtesting happens for the game outside of family and friends
* Consulting is fun and refreshing. It's nice to think about a design problem for a project that you do not need to then develop yourself. It provides you with freedom to think of ideas and solutions without ultimate responsibility.
