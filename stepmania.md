Been playing Stepmania since maybe 2004.

Started playing because DDR was becoming popular and there werent many places my friends and I could play in Minnesota. We found SM and started playing vs. each other. We started by using the directional keys to play, and used one hand. It seemed like it gave it a more "pure" experience that was closer to the arcade. Playing StepMania was still an attempt to emulate the arcade experience. I remember looking at home DDR pads and coveting them, especially the nice RedOctane and Cobalt Flux pads. I never gone one, though, since they were too expensive.

We started off playing songs that were from the original arcade mixes. I remember playing at arcade difficulties for a long time. Just being able to complete a song on Heavy was an accomplishment.

At some point we discovered that players in the community were making their own songs especially for players that used keyboard to play and that would be impossible to play using an arcade pad.

That's where it ended.

A friend of mine was always slightly better than I was, and I kept striving to keep up with his ability.

We broke out of using one hand to play DDR when we started playing these more difficult songs. The restriction was arbitrary and plenty of music games use two hands, anyway. We changed the keyboard layout that we used, as well. Instead of using the directional keys and trying to fit both of our hands on them (which we tried for a while), we remapped the keys to a more natural position.

We also started using "C-MOD", a speed modifier, to play. The C stands for "constant", and it ensured that the spacing between steps as they appeared on the screen would be visually consistent, irrespective of the BPM of the song.

You lose some information by using C-MOD, since some stepfile creators use BPM in creative ways, sometimes stopping the movment to accentuate parts of the song or to add difficulty. A lot of songs also change in BPM, too, and it's harder to notice with C-MOD. I've also used "note" skins for the arrows for as long as I remember (colors represent different notes, e.g. red & blue are on-beat while yellow and other colors are off-beat at different timings). Combining note skins with C-MOD allowed me to read songs more like sheet music. There's other options like X-MOD and M-MOD now, but back when we started playing these were not options.

I started out using C-MOD levels around C300, and now I play with C550-C600 (the number represents the equivalent BPM). I use C450 for a long time, too.

* Change in keyboard mapping over time
* Change in speed settings over time
* Change in song pack choice over time
* Choice of noteskin
* Why do I keep playing
* Physical limitations
    - Contacts and glasses -> blinking is tricky
    - Focus and difficulty
* Exhibitionism
* Flow state and muscle memory, brain hacks
    - It's easier to play harder songs than simple ones, I can stop myself from thinking when I play a hard song and just react.
