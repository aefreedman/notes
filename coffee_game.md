# What I like about tycoon & management games

*(transcript)*

>The mechanics are usually relatively simple but lead to complex systems. They usually work by combining positive feedback loops to create gameplay that becomes increasingly busy and hectic, with lots of moving parts and autonomous subsystems, e.g. SimCity. Management games are usually more "local" in theme, but use the same narrative of growth, usually at the personal (micro) rather than macro level, e.g. Diner Dash.

>The games feel good to play because they take a hackneyed narrative -- accumulation and increase in wealth and prosperity -- and abstracts that process into a system that seems to almost play itself. The combination of narrative and mechanics fit well on mobile because the platform further enforces simplicity of the interaction.

>Compare SimCity to Clash of Clans. The high-level goals are the same, but SimCity focuses move on micromanagement and provides more room for the user to make egregious errors. The user's interaction is much more open-ended and nuanced. Clash of Clans, meanwhile, forgoes the super-micromanagement (no tax policy).

>The simplicity is both a requirement of the mobile platform and a design choice. The context for play is transitive and short and touch interfaces are very low-fidelity. The result is that the system feels natural and the abstractions feel good. The same simplicity in SimCity would feel cheap and misleading.

>Perhaps this is where simulation and tycoon/management genres diverge and why the most popular management/tycoon games on mobile don't sell themselves as sims. They also all convey fantasy or other abstract or absurd themes. This may be another way to distance the game from any negative connotations in the sim genre (both personal identified connotations of "gamer" or "hardcore" and design implications of simulation).

>Clash of Clans seems to work because it has a very general appeal. The colors are very natural (light, but earth-tone dominant) and the characters are friendly, unimposing, and cartoonish while still carrying the fantasy/warfare theme.
