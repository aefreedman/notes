## Keynote -- Brandon Quarteraro, VC & Investment

[Top](#game-dev-hacker)

Acquisitions and investments across the industry into games companies.
Cost of distribution and user acquisition has decreased greatly (digital distribution and direct to consumer).
Revenue per user is increasing
Digital distribution is overcoming retail.
Mobile gaming revenue is expected to grow through 2017
Mobile's share of the market is expected to increase while console and PC will remain stagnant.

2015 is the year of MMOs, VR, and ESports

ESports in 2012-2018 - 24.18% CAGR

Casual games may cool down as developers and investors look for the next innovative product.

## The Challenge For Indie Devs to Get Published

* Do devs need a publisher?
    - Having enough capital to spend money on marketing is important
    - you don't _need_ one but the role of a publisher is changing in today's market.
    - "strategic partnership" that reduces the risk of game development and takes more control of the luck component of launching a game
    - having a publisher can help a developer by providing oversight. having another set of eyes on the project
    - for small developers, having a partnership with a larger publisher helps other companies see the developer as a more legitimate partner
* Be careful with licenses on open source software
* Financing, licensing and publishing agreements are tricky
    - Find advisors and lawyers that have experience
* Talk to developers that have worked with a potential partner before signing an agreement
* Developers and publishers need to understand each other and trust each other
* How do you "try" a publisher?
    - Look for terms in the agreements that allow you to back out of the agreement if the terms aren't met
    - Have clearly definied terms
* Publishers don't need exclusivity in all regions; you can negotiate to work with multiple publishers in regions that they have more knowledge in
* How do you approach publishers?
    - Have a professional public face
    - Use your team's experience and ability, not the ideas
    - Confidence
    - Awards are good promotion
    - Get publishers to come to you (make your studio attractive to publishers)
    - Go to events and talk to people

## Rovio - Case Study (by Mikko Setala, Rovio)

[Top](#game-dev-hacker)

2005 - Rovio: "Games for gamers" was a bad idea. Almost went bankrupt 4 times.
Pivoted to "delight the fans". Made Angry Birds. Now 2.1Bn downloads & 27M Facebook followers. Couldn't do this before social media. The consumer has the power to make brands powerful.

Rovio works with a lot of partners in various markets, e.g. Walmart and Toys'R'Us. Rovio is more like a traditional entertainment company.

Angry Birds Toons -> embedded in Angry Birds Games and other platforms, becomes a way to distribute other media.

Diversification of portfolio:

* Angry Birds
    - Games
    - Consumer Products
    - Animation
    - Books & Learning
    - Ads

Books & Learning aren't very profitable, but the goal is to control the story.

### How did Angry Birds get to where it is now?

* Trial and error, making bets
* Angry Birds was one of the first games created with touch screens as the primary input device and exclusively for touch devices
* Premium vs. f2p
    - f2p wasn't a popular business model when angry birds was new
    - Apple had different policies than it does now concerning f2p [that made it less attractive]
* [For a top brand] you need to be able to give the brand a rest
    - you can't be at the top all the time
    - come back when you have a story to tell
* Diversification
    - games are still the biggest source of revenue for Rovio
    - Rovio's other businesses are longer term investments
    - other businesses (like consumer products) are more seasonal

## Marketing In-game Advertising

[Top](#game-dev-hacker)

There's different kinds of advertising

* Performance ads (e.g. ads that lead to installations)
* Brand ads (like TV ads that advertise a brand)
* Incentivized ads (ads that provide something material to the user in exchange for viewing)

Not all ads are the same.

Facebook ads have better targeting than the other platforms.

For devs: find someone that you know or someone who knows someone that can get you included in a package or larger deal to get add fill.

For ads in game: UX is good for incentivized ads, they provide value to the players

Incentivised ads can be tricky for ingame economies, especially in games that are older. New ads or rewards can flood the market and upset the status quo.

Banner ads are not the way to go to support yourself as an independent developer.

Crossy Road: the game is a container for the ad and the ad looks like part of the game and serves a purpose [which is why the ads in the game are successful and the game is (financially) successful as a result]

Focus on ad placement

The platform affects how users of games, even users who play the same game on different platforms. You will need to target users differently based on platform [user profiles are platform-specific].

## Fundamentals of Game Design

[Top](#game-dev-hacker)

Greg: context, how and where. moma game: people didn't want to play a game in a museum, even if the game was fun

David: simplicity, rules, aesthetics. communicating the game without the need for the player to play it [also talked a lot about tactile qualities of games]

Jason: enjoyment

## Mobile games

Preserving a sense of imagination in the face of data

using UI elements of not-yet-implemented features to get data about which feature should be implemented next.

## Google Play

[Top](#game-dev-hacker)

Think globally: 2.5x US sales when sales are primarily international

Payment methods: Credit cards are #1 in the US, direct carrier billing is #1 in Japan, paypal is most popular in Germany, China is credit cards.

Landing page tips [most important]:
* Short, clear title
* Clear description
* high resolution screenshots
* video previews

Localizing listings can result in 6x sales
Localizing pricing, e.g. Japan, leads to more sales: 100 yen performs 2x better than prices like 101 yen or 97 yen (a few cents difference)

Localize your business model [some sales models perform better in some regions]

Most top grossing apps are free, with the exception of Minecraft.

Ratings are good.

Apps designed for tablets monetize 2x as well as phones.

Strategies for encouraging purchasing: increasing value over time (Evernote)
